I am currently a PhD student in [DMSE](https://dmse.mit.edu) of MIT and I work in Laboratory for Atomistic and Molecular Mechanics ([LAMM](http://lamm.mit.edu)). My research interests include combining machine learning and deep learning techniques with multiscale simulation methods (FEM,MD,DFT) to accelerate the property calculations and designs of diverse materials such as composites, nanomaterials and biological materials. Before that, I got my bachelor degree in Physics from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences ([UCAS](https://english.cas.cn)). I was also an intern at Toyota Research Institute ([TRI](https://www.tri.global)), working on AI for battery materials.
