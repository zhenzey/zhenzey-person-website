summary: ""
abstract: 'Materials-by-design is new paradigm to develop novel high-performance materials. However, finding materials with superior properties is often computationally or experimentally intractable because of the astronomical number of possible combinations in the design space. Especially for composite materials, the heterogeneity and structural complexity really hinder us from calculating materials properties and searching for optimal designs at low costs. Fortunately, with the recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML), new approaches and perspectives are provided to solve the puzzles. This study is proposed to leverage deep learning methods to bridge the gap between a material’s microstructure – the design space – and the physical performance. Specifically, it will answer research questions about how to use AI for fast predictions on physical fields of composite materials like stress or strain directly from the input materials geometry. Using a game-theory based conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs), an end-to-end deep learning approach are developed to give accurate predictions on not only physical fields data but also derivative global properties such as modulus and recoverability. Furthermore, the proposed approach offers extensibility by predicting complex materials behaviors regardless of component shapes, boundary conditions and geometrical hierarchy, providing new perspectives of performing physical modeling and simulations. The method outperforms some conventional numerical methods such as finite element analysis (FEA) and is able to vastly improves the efficiency of evaluating physical properties of hierarchical materials directly from the geometry of its structural makeup. In addition, the idea of geometry-to-field translation can also be applied to other areas in the sciences, such as density functional theory fields, fluid mechanical fields, or electromagnetism.'
