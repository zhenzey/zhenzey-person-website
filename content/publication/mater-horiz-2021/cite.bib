abstract  ="Artificial intelligence{,} especially machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms{,} is becoming an important tool in the fields of materials and mechanical engineering{,} attributed to its power to predict materials properties{,} design de novo materials and discover new mechanisms beyond intuitions. As the structural complexity of novel materials soars{,} the material design problem to optimize mechanical behaviors can involve massive design spaces that are intractable for conventional methods. Addressing this challenge{,} ML models trained from large material datasets that relate structure{,} properties and function at multiple hierarchical levels have offered new avenues for fast exploration of the design spaces. The performance of a ML-based materials design approach relies on the collection or generation of a large dataset that is properly preprocessed using the domain knowledge of materials science underlying chemical and physical concepts{,} and a suitable selection of the applied ML model. Recent breakthroughs in ML techniques have created vast opportunities for not only overcoming long-standing mechanics problems but also for developing unprecedented materials design strategies. In this review{,} we first present a brief introduction of state-of-the-art ML models{,} algorithms and structures. Then{,} we discuss the importance of data collection{,} generation and preprocessing. The applications in mechanical property prediction{,} materials design and computational methods using ML-based approaches are summarized{,} followed by perspectives on opportunities and open challenges in this emerging and exciting field."}
